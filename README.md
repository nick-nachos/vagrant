# vagrant

An attempt to automate (as much as possible) the provisioning of my development environment by using Vagrant. The main idea is to have Vagrant set up the base OS and as much as possible of the application layer (development tools, web browsers etc.) so that installing from scratch will require a minimum of manual interaction with the virtual machine.

## Prerequisites

* VirtualBox 5
* Vagrant 1.9
* [VirtualBox Guest Additions plugin](https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest) for Vagrant
